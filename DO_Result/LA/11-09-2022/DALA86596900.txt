HMM applies a “48 HR’ rule to all INL cutoff dates when a vessel schedule change occurs. This rule is intended to reduce any inconvenience or service disruption to you, our
valued customer. In case port cutoff changes within 48 HRs before the current ERD begins and beyond, your ERD and RAIL CUTOFF DATES WILL NOT CHANGE.

If schedule has changed within this window, and you would prefer the revised ERD / Rail Cutoff, please contact your regional customer service team to provide.
