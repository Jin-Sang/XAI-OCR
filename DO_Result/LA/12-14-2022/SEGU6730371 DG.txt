Printed: 4/26/2016 at 8:36:43AM
SECTION 4 - FIRST AID MEASURES

Inhalation: If inhaled, remove to fresh air. If not breathing, give artifitial respiration or give oxygen by trained
personnel. Seek immediate medical attention.

Eye Contact: Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for 10 to 15 minutes. Get medical attention, if irritation or
symptoms of overexposure persists.

Skin Contact: Immediately wash skin with soap and water. Get medical attention if irritation developes or persist.
Ingestion: If swallowed, DO NOT induce vomiting. Call physician or poison control center immediately. Never give
anything by mouth to an unconscious person.

Other First Aid: Due to possible aspiration into lungs, DO NOT induce vomiting if ingested. Provide a glass of water
to dilute the material in the stomach. If vomiting occurs naturally, have person lean forward to reduce risk of aspiration .

SECTION 5 - FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

Flash Point: 27 C (81 F)
LEL: 1.00 UEL: 7.00

Suitable Extinguishing Media: Use dry chemical, foam, carbon dioxide, or water fog to extinguish fire. Water may
not be effective to extinguish fire. Spattering of flammable liquid may result from spraying water.

Specific Hazards arising from the Chemical: Minimize breathing gases, vapors, fumes or decomposition

products. at elevated temperatures, vapors can form an ignitable mixture with air. Vapors can flow along surfaces to
distant ignition sources and flash back. Closed containers may explode when exposed to heat.

Protection of Firefighters: Water may be unsuitable as an extinguishing media, but helpful in keeping adjacent
containers cool. If a leak or spill has ignited, use water spray to disperse the vapors and to protect the men
attempting to stop leak.

Protective Equipment and Precautions for Firefighters: Wear self-contained breathing apparatus and full

protective gear.

SECTION 6 - ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

Personal Precautions: Use proper personal protective equipment as listed in Section 8.

Environmental Precautions: Avoid runoff into storm sewers, ditches and waterways.

Methods for Containment: Contain spilled liquid with sand or earth, DO NOT use combustible materials, such as
sawdust.

Methods for Clean-up: Remove all sources of ignition. Provide ventilation. Absorb spill with inert material (dry sand
or earth), colllect spill with a non-sparking tool then place in a chemical waste container for disposal.

SECTION 7 - HANDLING AND STORAGE

Handling: Use with adequate ventilation. Avoid breathing vapor and contacts with eyes, skin and clothing. Material
will accumulate static charges which may cause an electrical spark (ignition source), bond and ground containers
when transferring material. Use spark-proof tools and explosion-proof equipment. Do not reuse containers without
proper cleaning or reconditioning.

Hygiene Practices: Wash thoroughly after handling. Avoid contact with eyes and skin. Avoid inhaling vapor or mist.
Storage: Store in a cool dry, well ventilated area away from sources of heat, combustible materials and incompatible
substances. Keep container tightly closed when not in use.

mg/m3 STEL

Engineering Controls: Use appropriate engineering control such as process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation or
other engineering controls to control airborne levels below recommended exposure limits. Good general ventilation
should be sufficient to control airborne levels. Where such systems are not effective, wear suitable personal protective
equipment, which performs satisfactorily and meets OSHA or other recognized standards. Consult with local
procedures for selection, training, inspection and maintenance of the personal protective equipment.

Eye / Face Protection: Wear protective glasses or splash goggles as described by 29 CFR 1910.133, OSHA eye

and face protection regulations.

Skin Protection: Chemical-resistant gloves and chemical goggles, face-shield and synthetic apron or coveralls should
be used to prevent contact with eye, skin or clothing.

Respiratory Protection: A NIOSH-approved air-purifying respirator with an organic vapor cartridge or canister may be
permissible under certain circumstances where airborne concentrations are expected to exceed exposure limits.
Protection provided by air-purifying respirators is limited. Use a positive-pressure, air-supplied respirator if there is any
potential for uncontrolled release, exposure levels are not known or any other circumstances where air-purifying
respirators may not provide adequate protection.

General Hygiene Considerations: Avoid breathing vapor or mist. Avoid contact with eyes and skin, wash thoroughly
after handling and before eating or drinking.
