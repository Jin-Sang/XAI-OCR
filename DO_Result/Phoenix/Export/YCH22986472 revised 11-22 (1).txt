In efforts to improve our system, the booking number format will be updated to expand the range. Starting November 1, 2022, the booking number will incorporate an
additional two digits that signify the year of the booking creation. This will increase the booking number format. For example: YCH22123456 - prefix (YCH), year (22), and
number (123456). Bookings made before the starting date of the new booking number format will still retain the old format, prefix and number. As always, please refer to the
whole booking number, whether old format or new format, when contacting the booking office to avoid confusion and delay. We look forward to continuing our service to our
customers.

Thank you.

IMPORTANT NOTICE

Date: September 18, 2018

Dear Shipper,

We wish to bring to your attention to the first line of the "Booking Remarks", where you find the hazardous cargo approval number. This reference number starts with
"USSOL" followed by 11 digits. Effective immediately, it is to be added to the final Hazardous declaration. We urge Your team to review the accuracy of this reference number
when writing or typing it on the declaration.

We focus on the accuracy to ensure the container(s) are laden in a timely manner and on the vessel/voyage for which they are booked. The vessel operator has the full authority
to leave behind container(s) with declarations missing USSOL# or mistyped number. In the event this occurs and the container remains behind all charges assessed by the
terminal are for the account of the shipper.

We greatly appreciate your compliance to this THEA requirement.

Tf you have questions in this regard, or have multiple containers under one booking, please reach out to our DG customer service team for correct assignment of the USSOL# to

your containers.
