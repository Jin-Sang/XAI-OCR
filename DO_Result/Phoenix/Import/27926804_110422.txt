unsalvageable, without the need for any inspection and the Carrier shall be liable for the full value of the shipment. Carrier is

sole responsibility. Carrier must meet and comply to shipper requirements at the facility. All drivers must wear masks or
facial coverings to the extent required by laws or facilities. Carrier must be in full compliance with the Food Safety
